# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Overview

The idea of working with remote systems—more especially, servers—is examined in this module. Remote systems are frequently situated in various physical locations, in contrast to standard tasks that are carried out directly on personal computers. Understanding how to connect to and operate with these remote systems is the main goal of this lab.

## Lab Instructions

Up until this point, our lab activities have been conducted on personal laptops. However, this lab delves into the challenge of accessing systems that are not nearby. We will explore how to remotely connect to servers, which are typically located away from our physical locations, and perform tasks as if we were working directly on those systems.

This lab will provide practical experience in connecting to remote systems and understanding how to interact with them.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to house the code and documentation related to Lab 6 of INET4031. Through this lab, you will learn about:

- The concept of servers and remote connections.
- Tools and methods for connecting to remote systems.
- Working efficiently with remote systems, even when not physically nearby.

## Files and Code

This repository contains all the necessary files, code, and instructions for completing the tasks in Lab 6. Please ensure you follow the instructions carefully to connect and work with the remote systems.
